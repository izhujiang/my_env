Note that this will not work if Zsh is not in your authorized shells list (/etc/shells),
or if you don't have permission to use chsh.
  + check and confirm zsh: zsh --version
  + check the following instructions here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
  + Make it your default shell: chsh -s $(which zsh)<br>


+ "caps lock" -> "esc", optional.
  + linux:
    
    open /etc/default/keyboard, set [ref:](https://thesynack.com/posts/persistent-capslock-behavior/)

### Installation

```
  git clone https://github.com/izhujiang/my_env ~/repo/my_env
  cd ~/repo/my_env/scripts
  sudo ./my_env_boot.sh
```

<br>
Notes:<br>
(1)Provide sudo password at the beginning of the installing process.<br>
(2)Confirm with "y" enable installing linuxbrew into /home/linuxbrew directory.<br>
(3)Config git with built-in user(me (:) and mail, coming the changes.<br>
Try to figure out how to do it totally automatically without any promot using parameters.
<br>

+ run as non-sudoer:
If you do not yourself have admin privileges, consider asking your admin staff
to create a linuxbrew role account for you with home directory /home/linuxbrew [See Homebrew on Linux])(https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).
run:<br>

### Trouble shooting:

#### Can't set zsh as default shell

only zsh in /etc/shells can be set as default shell.<br>
chsh command changes shell in /etc/passwd. to make default shell take affect, logout and re-login.

#### Other issues:

+ issue 1:
Problem:
permission denied: /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sitecustomize.py
Solution:
chmod 644 /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sitecustomize.py

+ issue 2:
Problem:
[oh-my-zsh] Insecure completion-dependent directories detected:
lrwxr-xr-x 1 apple admin 68 Apr 2 03:13 /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/\_pipenv -> ../../../Cellar/pipenv/2018.11.26_2/share/zsh/site-functions/\_pipenv

[oh-my-zsh] For safety, we will not load completions from these directories until
[oh-my-zsh] you fix their permissions and ownership and restart zsh.
[oh-my-zsh] See the above list for directories with group or other writability.

Solution:
To fix your permissions you can do so by disabling
the write permission of "group" and "others" and making sure that the
owner of these directories is either root or your current user.
The following command may help:
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w,o-w

If the above didn't help or you want to skip the verification of
insecure directories you can set the variable ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX to
"true" before oh-my-zsh is sourced in your .zshrc file.
